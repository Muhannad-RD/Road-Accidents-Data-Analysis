# Urban Accident Prediction: Chicago Crash Risk Analysis 

## Project Overview
This project presents a **Business Intelligence & Predictive Analytics** solution for urban traffic safety. Using Chicago's open data, I developed a machine learning pipeline to predict accident severity and an interactive dashboard to visualize risk factors.

## Business Intelligence Dashboard
The dashboard provides real-time insights into crash dynamics, allowing stakeholders to filter data by weather, time, and vehicle type.

## Technical Stack
* **Modeling:** LightGBM (Achieved 80% Test Accuracy).
* **Data Processing:** Python (Pandas, NumPy).
* **Visualization:** Power BI & Seaborn.
* **Reporting:** Comprehensive technical analysis in PDF.

## Strategic Insights
* **Peak Risk:** Identified specific "Rush Hour" windows where serious injuries are 30% more likely.
* **Weather Impact:** Clear weather doesn't mean safety; data shows a high volume of speed-related crashes during clear conditions.
* **Model Recall:** Optimized the model to catch 80% of severe accidents, prioritizing safety over simple accuracy.
